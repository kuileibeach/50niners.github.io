    <p>Do I need to be registered with the Hawaii Soccer Association (HSA)?<br><strong>Yes, For insurance purposes. HSA fee is $25</strong></p>
    <p>How much are the player fees?  
      <strong>Right now we are estimating the fee will be between $50 and $70.</strong></p>
    <p>Will the offsides rule be enforced?  Yes.</p>
    <p>Are referees giving cards for offenses?  Yes.  Red card suspensions will be decided by the Board.</p>
    <p>How many games will each team play?  Six regular season games and 2 playoffs.  Total of 8 games for each team.</p>
    <p>How will teams be formed? Will it be a 'social network' thing, or will you try to divide up the talent pool evenly?
      <strong>Players will be ranked and split into 4 teams (A,B,C,D).  Player evaluation and distribution determined by the Board.  Managers will blindly pull a team from hat.</strong></p>
    <p>Is there any exceptions such: 1962-1961 or moving players around?
      <strong>No exceptions for 1961 or 1962 yet.  If we need more players, Board will decide on lowering age requirement.  Currently, only players older than 68 years old can play on multiple teams if there's a shortage of players.</strong></p>
