    <p>Do I need to be registered with the Hawaii Soccer Association (HSA)?
      <strong>Yes, For insurance purposes. HSA fee is $25</strong></p>
    <p>How much are the player fees?  
      <strong>Right now we are estimating the fee will be between $50 and $70.</strong></p>
    <p>Will the offsides rule be enforced?
      <strong>Yes.  We are playing on a regulation size field.  If we decide to use a short sided field, Board will decide on offside rule.</strong></p>
    <p>Are referees giving cards for offenses?
      <strong>Yes.  Red card suspensions will be decided by the Board.</strong></p>
    <p>How many games will each team play?
      <strong>Six regular season games and 2 playoffs.  Total of 8 games for each team.</strong></p>
    <p>How will teams be formed? Will it be a 'social network' thing, or will you try to divide up the talent pool evenly?
      <strong>Players will be ranked and split into 4 teams (A,B,C,D).  Player evaluation and distribution determined by the Board.  Managers will blindly pull a team from hat.</strong></p>
    <p>Is there any exceptions such: 1962-1961 or moving players around?
      <strong>No exceptions for 1961 or 1962 yet.  If we need more players, Board will decide on lowering age requirement.  Currently, only players older than 68 years old can play on multiple teams if there's a shortage of players.</strong></p>
    <p>Will this be AM or PM games?
      <strong>Games will be played on Saturday.  First game is at 1PM, and last game is at 3PM.  Fourty minute halves with water break for each half.</strong></p>
    <p>I indicated on survey that I will play all schedule games, and schedule conflicts may arise.  Will I be red carded for not showing up to game?
      <strong>No.  Survey Question on your game availability information was intended to get an idea on participation numbers for the Summer League.</strong></p>
